This mini project allows the user to add students to a list, take attendance for each student, and view an attendance report. The list of students is implemented as an array of Student structures. The program uses a simple menu-based interface to allow the user to navigate the different options.

Note that this code assumes that the user enters valid inputs (e.g. a valid student name, valid attendance marks). You may want to add additional input validation to make the program more robust.
